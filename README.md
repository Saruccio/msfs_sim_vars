# msfs_sim_vars

🛩️ A set of utilities for extracting and analyzing Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) simulation variables. These tools help convert official documentation into structured Excel/CSV tables and identify which variables are actively used in a running simulation.

## MSFS Docs to Var TABs (`msfs_doc_to_tabsimvars.py`)

This script parses the official MSFS2020 online technical documentation to extract simulation variables. For each documentation page, it generates an Excel file containing:

- Page reference  
- Variable name  
- Unit of measurement  
- Description  

It also produces a consolidated Excel file (`msfs2020_sim_vars.xlsx`) that merges all individual tables into a single dataset for streamlined analysis.

## MSFS Sim Var Scanner (`msfs_sim_var_scanner.py`)

This utility helps identify which simulation variables are currently active during a live MSFS session. It's especially useful for cockpit builders who want to map gauges and indicators to the correct variables—without relying on trial and error.

- The list of variables to scan is sourced from the Excel file generated by `msfs_doc_to_tabsimvars.py`.

### How to Use

1. Launch MSFS and start a simulation.
2. Once the simulation reaches a steady state, run `msfs_sim_var_scanner.py`, passing 
   2.1 a Excel file with variables to inspect.
   2.2 a list of indexes needed for indexed variables (e.g., `GENERAL_ENG_RPM:index`).
4. The script will populate the `value` column in the output table:
   - Standard variables will show a single value.
   - Indexed variables will show a list of values (e.g., `[value 1, value 2]`).
