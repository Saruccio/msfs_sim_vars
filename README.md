# msfs_sim_vars
Utilities for extracting MSFS simulation variables into Excel or CSV tables, and discovering of which variables are currently available in the active simulation.

## MSFS Docs To Var TABs (msfs_doc_to_tabsimvars.py)
MSFS Docs To Var TABs is a utility that parses the official MSFS2020 online technical documentation to extract simulation variables. For each documentation page, it generates an Excel file listing the variable name, associated page reference, unit of measurement, and description. Additionally, it produces a consolidated Excel file that merges all individual tables into a single dataset for streamlined analysis.
